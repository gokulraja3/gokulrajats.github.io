                <h2><b>Are you the one who likes to get Motivated ? Then this is for you.</b></h2>
                <p>I came across a beautiful article today, entitled how motivation is considered as a SLAVERY.
                    That made a huge impact on me to make this post. We as Human Beings, looks for all the motivation from an external force.
                    All motivation is external. Have you ever found yourself, pushed by an external force that acts upon you and make you react to something in certain way.
                    So, that is what we are going to call MOTIVATION?. 
                </p>
                <p>I have been and around people who used to watch movies,music, or some fancy stories from which they 
                    used to get motivated to certain effect.So, that is what we are going to call the MOTIVATION?
                </p>

                <p> Motivation is an Energy, a Power, a Force within yourself. And we people are shifting all those power to some 
                    external factors.
                </p>

                <div class="alert alert-success">
                    If the motivation can come from outside, motivation will disappear when that 'outside' disappears.
                </div>

                <h3>Motivational Speakers and their One-Night Motivation </h3>
                <p> We all have come across motivational speeches in our life. A person makes arousing speech and TADA!! you are Motivated.
                    Does that person gonna stay with you all day? Hell, No!. Once that person is gone, the Motivation too.
                    This is the reality happening with everyone of us. We are being driven by a book, a movie, speakers, an event, an incident, etc.
                    These are all external. It come and go , so does the motivation.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         We all get motivated by various sources like our Father, Mother, Friends, Relatives, Wife, Kids and even from some random person.
                         Each of them motivates us to do something different. At the end of the day, where we are gonna go?
                         This is a Complete distraction driven by all external forces.
                     </p>
                    <h3>The Reality</h3>
                    <p>The real action does not come from motivation. A powerful, youthful action does not come from motivation. It comes
                        from Understanding and Intelligence. Real actions doesn't depend on external forces.
                    </p>
                    <div class="alert alert-success"><h4>Life is full of moments, so learn to respond to each moment intelligently and never get driven
                        by any external dark forces.
                    </h4></div>
